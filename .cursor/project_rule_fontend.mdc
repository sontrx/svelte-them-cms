# Figma Design Implementation Rule

When asked to implement a Figma design, the process is as follows:

1. **Initial Layout (Step 1):**
   - The user will provide a section image (called an "illustration") and a Figma link to the section node.
   - Build the HTML and CSS based on the illustration image to match the appearance as closely as possible.
   - Use Tailwind CSS version 4 for all CSS utility classes.
   - Before styling, read the `main.css` file to acknowledge and utilize any existing CSS rules or variables.

2. **Figma Data Correction (Step 2):**
   - Once the user accepts the overall layout, use the provided Figma link to fetch specific design data (CSS variables, dimensions, SVGs, images) using the MCP Figma tool.
   - List the fetched theme assets (variables, images, SVGs, etc.) to the user for preview.
   - Replace the initial layout's approximations with the precise data from Figma, ensuring the overall look remains consistent but correctness is improved.

The concept is to first match the look and feel using the illustration, then use Figma data for accuracy and correctness while preserving the established layout.
